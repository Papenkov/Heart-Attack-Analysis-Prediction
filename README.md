# Heart-Attack-Analysis-Prediction

This is a medical [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset) with some features that probably can help predict heart attacks. In this notebook I will do:

- Some visual analysis and show some relationships between features
- Fit predictive models
- Adjust recall metric to 95% for chosen model
- Summaryze some observations
